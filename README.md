#INTRODUCTION<br>
College management system is an integrated web application that handles various academic and non-academic activities of a College/Academic Institute. The system can be accessed by every students/faculties/employees of the institution through internet connected computers or internet enabled mobile devices with the aid of his user name and password. Every user will have a customized home page with his/her profile management facilities.<br>
Through links that displays in the home page the user can access different options of the website assigned to him. Though the system allows access to every one there is a significant security risk involved in this project. To tackle this problem we have a modular structure in the proposed system and a complete isolation of the financial and administrative modules from the public portal. <br>
Web services will interact to the financial and administrative modules to fetch necessary information to display in the public portal. Although a standard password policy will be followed in the designing of the system to prevent the possibilities of malicious activities of itching users.
A self-driven module in the proposed system will accomplish the automated tasks such as Email Alerts, SMS alerts, Notifications to the administrator etc. 
Theoretical Background<br>
Today in colleges student details are entered manually. The student details in separate records are tedious task. Referring to all these records and updating is needed. There is a chance for more manual errors.<br><br>
Problems in existing system:<br>
•	It was limited to a single system.<br>
•	It was less user-friendly.<br>
•	It have a lots of manual work (Manual system does not mean that we are working with pen and paper, it also include working on spread sheets and other simple software's)<br>
•	It requires more no of employees need to work.<br>
•	It was time consuming process.<br>
•	The present system was very less secure.<br>
•	It is unable to generate different kinds of report.<br>
<br><br>
Solution to these problems: <br>
The development of the new system contains the following activities, which try to automate the entire process keeping in view of the database integration approach.<br>
•	User friendliness is provided in the application with various controls.<br>
•	The system makes the overall project management much easier and flexible.<br>
•	It can be accessed over the Internet.<br>
•	Various classes have been used to provide file upload and mail features. <br>
•	There is no risk of data mismanagement at any level while the project development is under process.<br>
•	It provides high level of security using different protocols like https etc.<br>
