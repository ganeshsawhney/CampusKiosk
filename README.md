#INTRODUCTION
College management system is an integrated web application that handles various academic and non-academic activities of a College/Academic Institute. The system can be accessed by every students/faculties/employees of the institution through internet connected computers or internet enabled mobile devices with the aid of his user name and password. Every user will have a customized home page with his/her profile management facilities.
Through links that displays in the home page the user can access different options of the website assigned to him. Though the system allows access to every one there is a significant security risk involved in this project. To tackle this problem we have a modular structure in the proposed system and a complete isolation of the financial and administrative modules from the public portal. 
Web services will interact to the financial and administrative modules to fetch necessary information to display in the public portal. Although a standard password policy will be followed in the designing of the system to prevent the possibilities of malicious activities of itching users.
A self-driven module in the proposed system will accomplish the automated tasks such as Email Alerts, SMS alerts, Notifications to the administrator etc. 
Theoretical Background
Today in colleges student details are entered manually. The student details in separate records are tedious task. Referring to all these records and updating is needed. There is a chance for more manual errors.
Problems in existing system:
•	It was limited to a single system.
•	It was less user-friendly.
•	It have a lots of manual work (Manual system does not mean that we are working with pen and paper, it also include working on spread sheets and other simple software's) 
•	It requires more no of employees need to work.
•	It was time consuming process.
•	The present system was very less secure.
•	It is unable to generate different kinds of report.

Solution to these problems: 
The development of the new system contains the following activities, which try to automate the entire process keeping in view of the database integration approach.
•	User friendliness is provided in the application with various controls.
•	The system makes the overall project management much easier and flexible.
•	It can be accessed over the Internet.
•	Various classes have been used to provide file upload and mail features. 
•	There is no risk of data mismanagement at any level while the project development is under process.
